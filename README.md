# RMDHMern
This website was built using full-stack technologies such as React, Node, Express, HTML, and CSS.
The backend of the project is fully hosted on MongoDB and so is the frontend.

This project came about through the MERN stack Course offered by freeCodeCamp.org

You can access the link to the actual website here -> https://restaurant-reviews-icpdy.mongodbstitch.com/  (it would be available for a short amount of time)

A huge thanks to freeCodeCamp for this free resource!
